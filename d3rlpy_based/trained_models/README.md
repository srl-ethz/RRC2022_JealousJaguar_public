for the multi-policy method, copy the weights (\*_1.pt) and d3rlpy json file (\*_1.json) and metadata file (\*_metadata_1.json) (which is manually created) to this directory.
make sure to memo where each model comes from

policy with index 1 should be highest performing one, 2 being next, and so on...
